Anagram:

Given two lists A and B, and B is an anagram of A. B is an anagram of A means B is made by randomizing the order of the elements in A.
We want to find an index mapping P, from A to B. A mapping P[i] = j means the ith element in A appears in B at index j.
These lists A and B may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.
For example, given
Input
5
12 28 46 32 50
50 12 32 46 28
Output
1 4 3 2 0
Explanation
A = [12, 28, 46, 32, 50]
B = [50, 12, 32, 46, 28]
We should return
[1, 4, 3, 2, 0]
as P[0] = 1 because the 0th element of A appears at B[1], and P[1] = 4 because the 1st element of A appears at B[4], and so on.
Note:
1.	A, B have equal lengths in range [1, 100].
2.	A[i], B[i] are integers in range [0, 10^5].

Program:

def index_mapping(A, B):
    index_map = {num: i for i, num in enumerate(B)}
    return ' '.join(str(index_map[num]) for num in A)
n=int(input())  
A = list(map(int, input().split()))  
B = list(map(int, input().split()))  
print(index_mapping(A, B))
